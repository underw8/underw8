# Hey there! üëã I'm Steven üöÄ

I'm an Infrastructure DevOps Engineer üõ†Ô∏è by day, motorbike enthusiast üèçÔ∏è by night, and a self-proclaimed coffee-powered coder ‚òï.

### üß∞ My Toolbox:
- üêç Python, but Node.js is my jam üçØ
- ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS cloud adventurer üå©Ô∏è with a soft spot for Terraform üöú
- üéØ Containers, microservices, and all the Fargate fun üåä
- üéÆ "Power-Shell" scripting ninja üê±‚Äçüë§

### üå± Currently Growing In:
- Learning Japanese üáØüáµ so I can debug in more languages!
- Solution Architecture üèóÔ∏è‚Äîlike DevOps but with more diagrams and fewer cables!

### üéì Certifications:
[![AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94e8aa3e-a43c-45e3-be73-98be99ce56da)](https://www.credly.com/badges/4eb2ff08-c6f1-4e1f-911b-27930607e495/public_url)
[![AWS Certified SysOps Administrator ‚Äì Associate](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d6599c8-1eb3-4b05-8af7-6166e724248b)](https://www.credly.com/badges/18c12936-4f70-408a-8021-691015fd6025/public_url)

### üèéÔ∏è Fun Facts:
- I can deploy infrastructure faster than I can decide where to order lunch ü•°.
- Coffee count: [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] (It‚Äôs never enough ‚òï).

#### üöß Warning:
> May contain traces of untested code and the occasional _debugging dance_. Proceed with caution (and coffee)! ‚òï‚ö†Ô∏è
