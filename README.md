# Hey there! üëã I'm Steven üöÄ

I'm an Infrastructure DevOps Engineer üõ†Ô∏è by day, motorbike enthusiast üèçÔ∏è by night, and a self-proclaimed coffee-powered coder ‚òï.

### üß∞ My Toolbox:
- üêç Python, but Node.js is my jam üçØ
- ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS cloud adventurer üå©Ô∏è with a soft spot for Terraform üöú
- üéØ Containers, microservices, and all the Fargate fun üåä
- üéÆ "Power-Shell" scripting ninja üê±‚Äçüë§

### üå± Currently Growing In:
- Learning Japanese üáØüáµ so I can debug in more languages!
- Solution Architecture üèóÔ∏è‚Äîlike DevOps but with more diagrams and fewer cables!

### üéì Certifications:

### üéØ On My Radar:
- Perfecting that one Terraform module I *swear* was finished last week... üõ†Ô∏è
- Making RDS behave like a well-trained puppy üêï‚Äçüéì
- Optimizing everything until my logs scream in joy üìà‚ú®

### üèéÔ∏è Fun Facts:
- I can deploy infrastructure faster than I can decide where to order lunch ü•°.
- Always up for a chat about motorbikes üèçÔ∏è or databases (weird combo, right? üòÜ)
- Coffee count: [‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà] (It‚Äôs never enough ‚òï).

### üöÄ Let‚Äôs Collaborate!
- **Ask me about:** Cloud architectures, Terraform hacks, or how to make your Node.js server scream with joy üéâ.
- **Hit me up:** For all things DevOps-y, or just to swap cool bike stories! üèçÔ∏èüí®

#### üöß Warning:
> May contain traces of untested code and the occasional _debugging dance_. Proceed with caution (and coffee)! ‚òï‚ö†Ô∏è
